# Reworking HTTP Tests using SpecFlow

In this task, we will rework the existing HTTP tests (Task 10) using SpecFlow, a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework. SpecFlow allows us to write tests in a more human-readable format and enhance collaboration between developers and non-developers.

We will create a separate branch in the repository to work on the SpecFlow version of the tests.

## Introduction

The goal of this task is to rework the existing HTTP tests using SpecFlow. This involves writing feature files that describe test scenarios in plain text and implementing step definitions to execute those scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following set up:
- Visual Studio or a compatible IDE for C# development.
- Existing HTTP tests from Task 10.
- SpecFlow and SpecFlow+Runner (if needed) installed in your project.

## SpecFlow Implementation

1. Create a new branch in your repository for the SpecFlow implementation. You can name it something like 'specflow-tests.'
2. Identify the HTTP tests that you want to rework using SpecFlow.
3. Create SpecFlow feature files for these tests. Feature files describe the scenarios in a human-readable format using Gherkin syntax.
4. Write scenarios in the feature files that cover the test cases you want to automate. These scenarios should be clear and descriptive.
5. Implement step definitions for the scenarios. Step definitions are written in C# and contain the automation logic.
6. Ensure that the SpecFlow tests can be executed successfully.

## Creating a Separate Branch

To create a separate branch for the SpecFlow implementation:

1. Use the version control system you are using (e.g., Git) to create a new branch from the current main or master branch.
2. Name the branch something descriptive, such as 'specflow-tests.'

## Conclusion

This README outlines the process of reworking HTTP tests using SpecFlow, a BDD framework. By creating a separate branch for the SpecFlow version, we can keep the original HTTP tests intact and collaborate on the SpecFlow implementation separately.
